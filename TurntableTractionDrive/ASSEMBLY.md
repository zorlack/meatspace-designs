# Turntable Taction Drive Assembly Guide

## Assembly

Assembly took two days, with the majority of time being spent drilling and tapping holes. All bolt holes are undersized for 3/8-24 with the idea being that plasma-cut holes are not very accurate so it's better to drill them after the fact and then tap the perfectly drilled holes. This worked fairly well but we broke plenty of bits and taps.

We found that the steel fit together perfectly on the day it arrived, but on the second day the top plate no longer fit perfectly on the welded-up sides. It seems like everything moved a little bit as it cooled down from being welded and this caused us some difficulty in assembly. Next time around we will weld the whole machine in a single session. Or perhaps keep the top tacked after the bottom is assembled.

The right-angle (Left/Right AKA Top/Bottom) configuration of the gear-reducer allows us to run one sprocket on top and another sprocket on the bottom. This is useful since 7/8" ID sprockets are quite beefy. Too beefy to fit both chains on a single output shaft from the gear-reducer. For the right-hand drive wheel we connected a ANSI #40 chain to an 11 tooth sprocket mounted on the bottom shaft.

On the left-hand of the machine we ran chain from a sprocket mounted on the top shaft of the gear-reducer. On this machine the chain is a bit too close to the top plate. In our next revision we'll try to lower the motor 1/4" by eliminating the motor gusset.

During our initial assembly we waited to weld the top until we verified that everything fit correctly. This isn't neccesary since all the hardware can be swapped-out even after the chassis is fully welded. After our test assembly we ran the machine at speed, adjusted it and then removed all the hardware for paint. We painted the chassis using oil-based black satin-finish paint.

We also welded on some store-bought handles in order to make moving the machine slightly less cumbersome.
